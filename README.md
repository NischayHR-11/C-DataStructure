## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of data structures implemented in C. Each data structure is carefully crafted to demonstrate its principles and use cases. The examples included will help you understand how to apply these data structures in real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and tools are utilized in this repository:

- **C Language**: The primary programming language used for implementing data structures.
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, used for compiling the C programs.
- **Make**: For automating the build process.

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NischayHR-11/C-DataStructure.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd C-DataStructure
    ```

3. **Compile the code:**
   - If a `Makefile` is provided, you can simply run:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can compile individual programs using GCC:
     ```bash
     gcc -o program_name program_name.c
     ```

4. **Run the executable:**
    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

## Usage

Explore different data structures by navigating to their respective folders. Each data structure includes a main C file demonstrating its usage and functionality. You can compile and run these files to see how each data structure works.

### Example Usage:

To compile and run an example using GCC:

```bash
gcc -o linked_list linked_list.c
./linked_list
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
C-DataStructure/
├── linked_list/
│   ├── linked_list.c
│   └── linked_list.h
├── stack/
│   ├── stack.c
│   └── stack.h
├── queue/
│   ├── queue.c
│   └── queue.h
├── ...
└── README.md
```

- **`linked_list/`**, **`stack/`**, **`queue/`**, etc.: Each folder contains the C files implementing the corresponding data structure.
- **`README.md`**: This file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have an idea for a new data structure implementation, feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions are well-documented and tested.
